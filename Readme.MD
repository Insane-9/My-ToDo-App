# Todo App

A modern, interactive Todo application built with React. This project demonstrates core React concepts through practical, application-based learning.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🎯 About This Project

This is an **application-based learning project** where I built a functional Todo application to understand and master React fundamentals. Instead of just learning theory, I learned by building a real-world application with actual features and functionality.

## 📚 What I Learned from This Project

### Core React Concepts
- **Component Architecture**: Breaking down UI into reusable, maintainable components
- **State Management**: Using `useState` hook to manage application state
- **Component Props**: Passing data and callbacks between parent and child components
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying different UI based on application state
- **List Rendering**: Efficiently rendering lists with React keys

### React Patterns & Best Practices
- **Lifting State Up**: Managing state at the appropriate component level
- **Controlled Components**: Creating form inputs that are controlled by React state
- **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs by composing smaller components
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions with proper event handlers
- **React Hooks**: Understanding how hooks simplify component logic

### Development & Deployment
- **Build Tools**: Working with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Module Bundling**: Understanding how to organize and bundle JavaScript modules
- **Deployment**: Deploying a React application to production
- **Development Workflow**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and development server setup

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add new todos
- ✅ Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Delete todos
- ✅ Clean, intuitive user interface
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Real-time state updates

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** - UI library for building interactive components
- **Vite** - Modern build tool with lightning-fast HMR
- **CSS** - Custom styling for responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Modern JavaScript features
